                    <blockquote>I cannot say enough good things about Eric that can equal the help he gave me back in the summer of 2016 and until now.
                        In late spring of 2016, two families encouraged me to create a website for my tutoring business. I did not feel I needed one,
                        but the families said it is easier for them to refer me if there is a website to share. It was around the time of an elementary
                        school friend’s birthday when I told the friend that I needed to find someone to help me create the website.
                        This friend is Eric’s dad.  It took me all of ten minutes to be interested in contacting Eric. <br> <br>
                        My work with Eric felt like I was working with a seasoned professional in the industry.  He answered every one of my little
                        suggestions along with all of my huge concerns.  Eric created a website beyond what I thought I needed.  His insightful
                        thoughts about scheduling being a major issue for my business he created a link that has helped reduce my hours of texting and
                        emailing to notify my clients of my availability by number too large to track.  I owe Eric more gratitude for his input on my
                        website than I think I have told him.  Here is the website – <a class="link" href="https://www.billbrownchoicetutoring.com">www.billbrownchoicetutoring.com</a>  I can also tell you that Eric had
                        a hand in choosing the name of my website. <br> <br>
                        If anyone is seeking Eric’s help in designing a website, then please reach out to me again.  My email address is <a class="link" href="mailto:collegechoice921@gmail.com?subject=Eric's Testimonial">collegechoice921@gmail.com</a></blockquote>
